# Introduction to RNA-seq using high-performance computing (HPC)

| Audience | Computational Skills Required | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | None | 2-day workshop (~13 hours of trainer-led time)|

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 2-day Introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis workshop. This workshop focuses on teaching basic computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement an RNA-seq data analysis workflow. It includes an introduction to shell (bash) and shell scripting. In addition to running the RNA-seq workflow from FASTQ files to count data, the workshop covers best practice guidlelines for RNA-seq experimental design and data organization/management.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing an RNA-seq experiment and analysis the resulting data.
